## Notes on Rubric Design

This rubric evaluates **quality of analysis and reasoning** rather than specific numerical results. Students should be assessed on:

- **Evidence-based reasoning**: Using experimental data to support conclusions
- **Depth of analysis**: Going beyond surface observations to understand underlying mechanisms
- **Experimental design**: Creating systematic comparisons and controlled experiments
- **Clear communication**: Using effective visualizations and explanations
- **Practical insights**: Connecting findings to real-world CNN development

**NOT** on:
- Achieving specific accuracy values
- Identifying predetermined "correct" hyperparameter ranges
- Matching instructor's exact findings
- Producing identical training curves

The goal is to reward thoughtful experimentation, clear reasoning, and meaningful insights - not answer-matching.
