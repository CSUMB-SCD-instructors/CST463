# PA1

This homework assignment is focusing on material from the first week or two of class, specifically on linear algebra and dimensionality reduction.
There are therefore two main parts:
- linear algebra
  - vectors
  - matrices
- dimensionality reduction
  - PCA
  - non-linear dimensionality reduction
