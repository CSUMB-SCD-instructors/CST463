## Instructions for Reviewers

You are evaluating the **quality of analysis and reasoning**, NOT checking for specific "correct" answers. Different students may draw different reasonable conclusions from the same data - this is expected and valuable!

Focus on:
- **Evidence-based reasoning**: Do they support claims with data from their experiments?
- **Depth of analysis**: Do they go beyond surface observations?
- **Clear communication**: Are visualizations effective and explanations clear?
- **Conceptual understanding**: Do they demonstrate understanding of underlying concepts?

## Rubric Design Philosophy

**Important Note for Instructors:**

This rubric intentionally:
- **Avoids specifying "correct" numerical results** (e.g., "identifies optimal range around X to Y")
- **Does not predetermine conclusions** (e.g., "correctly explains that Word2Vec performs best")
- **Focuses on process over outcomes**: reasoning quality, evidence usage, depth of analysis
- **Allows multiple valid interpretations**: Different conclusions are acceptable if well-justified

This approach maintains academic rigor while enabling genuine discovery and analysis, rather than students trying to match predetermined "right answers."

Students should be evaluated on:
1. **How** they analyze (methodology, evidence, reasoning)
2. **Depth** of thinking (beyond surface observations)
3. **Quality** of communication (clear, organized, appropriate for audience)

NOT on:
1. Achieving specific accuracy values
2. Identifying predetermined patterns
3. Matching instructor's exact conclusions
