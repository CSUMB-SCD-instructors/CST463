# Final Project

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to give you some experience in a realistic deep-learning project.   By 'realistic' I mean that you can take advantage of any resources you can find.

You will be working in a group of 2-4 students, that you are welcome to self-select or let me know if you want me to randomly assign you to a group.

## Instructions
- Select a project from the [list of project ideas](project_ideas.md) or suggest your own ([see details](project_ideas.md#suggest-your-own-project)).
- Figure out how to solve the problem.
  - This will involve reviewing course material and web research to see how others have solved it.  It is okay to borrow code, to use ChatGPT, etc., but *you must document every resource you use*.
  - Since you won't have a lot of time and probably won't have a lot of data, I expect you to try to leverage a pretrained model (see Section 8.3 of Chollet, Section 'Reusing Pretrained Layers' in Chapter 10 of Geron, and Section 'Hugging Face’s Transformers Library' in Chapter 16 of Geron).  You  may want to compare your results when you don't leverage a pretrained model with when you do.  Also, don't forget about the possibility of using pretrained embeddings, like GloVe.
  - You must go beyond solutions that you find.  For example, if you are working on a classification problem, can you achieve better accuracy?
- Generate submissions
  - Your proposal and update should be submited as markdown files.
  - Your final report must be a .ipynb file with all code and output showing.  The report should be well-organized and include plenty of commentary on the problem.  Be sure to identify your data set and list all the sources (including code) that you used.
- Meet with the instructor regularly during the project to make sure you are heading in the right direction.

## Submission

There are four submissions.  Three of these are for the entire team and should be a single submission per team. For the peer evaluation, each team member must make a submission.

1. ***Proposal*** (10 points) **team** submission
  - details can be found in [proposal.md](proposal.md)
  - Due after the first in-class work day
2. ***Update***: (15 points)) **team** submission
  - Details can be found in [update.md](update.md)
  - Due after the first week of the project
3. ***Final Submission***: (60 points)) **team** submission
  - Details can be found in [final-submission.md](final-submission.md)
  - Due on the day of the final exam
4. ***Peer Evaluation***: (15 points) **indvidual** submission
  - Please fill out the peer evaluation form found [here](https://forms.gle/B23isG63fFokr9Bx9)
