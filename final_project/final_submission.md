# Final Submission

Each team will submit one ipynb file that shows code and all output.  Coordinate with your teammates!!

***Late submissions are absolutely not accepted***, so don’t submit at the last minute.

I will also ask you to complete a questionnaire in which you will estimate how much of the project work was completed by you and your teammates.

## Grading

I will assess your project using your final report and on teamwork.  The max score is 75 points.

Grading components:
- (25 points) baseline results
  - Code that works and demonstrates that your baseline milestone was reached.
- (15 points) final results
  - Coding serious effort in trying to go beyond the baseline.
- (10 points) engineering judgment
  - Do you do sensible things?  Did you do the sensible things first?  Did you try to get past obstacles in a sensible way?
  - Was your work informed by your broad knowledge of data science and machine learning?
- (10 points) documentation
  - Is your notebook clear and well-organized?  There should be clear sections, and each section should start with a sentence or two of text.
  - Did you document the sources you borrowed from?  Did you make clear what you borrowed and what you developed yourself?
