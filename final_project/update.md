# Final project: update

The purpose of the project update is to make sure you're making steady progress on your project..

## Instructions:

Each team should fill out the [template project update document](update-template.md).
Each team should provide a notebook showing your first, baseline results, and any further results you have.
I do not expect this to be a polished report.  It should just show the code you've written and the output you've obtained.  Provide only one code file.

## Submission.

Only one person from each team should submit two files on Canvas:
- a PDF version of your project update document (use filename `update.pdf` or `update.md` as appropriate)
- an .ipynb. (use filename `update.ipynb`)

## Grading.

This project update is worth 15% of your overall project score.  Each team member will get the same credit aside from teamwork participation adjustments that I reserve the right to make independently of the rubric below.

- (10 points) Progress towards baseline.
  - Full credit if you've reached your baseline goal and can quantify how well it is working.
- (5 points) Clear project update.
  - Full credit if I can get a clear picture of your progress from the report.
