# Labs

This directory contains lab assignments and activities for in-class work.

## Structure

Each lab should follow this structure:
- `labX-name/` - Lab directory
  - `README.md` - Lab instructions
  - `Makefile` - Build configuration (if needed)
  - Starter code files

Labs are designed to be completed during class time with instructor guidance.
