# Gradient Descent Demo

Interactive demonstration of single-variable linear regression with gradient descent.

## Usage

```bash
python gradient_descent_demo.py
```

Choose between:
1. **Step-by-step mode**: Press Enter to advance through each iteration
2. **Quick run**: Automatic execution showing final results

## Features

- Simple gradient descent loop: `x = x - learning_rate * gradient`
- Real-time visualization of current fit line (bright red)
- Faded history of previous fit attempts
- Target optimal line (green dashed) for comparison
- Error reduction graph showing convergence
- Generated sample data with noise

Perfect for demonstrating the iterative nature of gradient descent and how it approaches the optimal solution step by step.
