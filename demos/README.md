# Demos

This directory contains demonstration code used during lectures.

## Structure

Each demo should be in its own directory:
- `demoX-topic/` - Demo directory
  - `README.md` - Demo explanation
  - Source code files
  - `Makefile` (if applicable)

Demos illustrate key concepts covered in lectures.
