## Grading

There are three groups of assignments, briefly described in the table below.
**Getting below a 40% in any of these three groups will result in failing the class.**

| Assignment Kind                                     | Value |
|:----------------------------------------------------|:-----:|
| [Programming assignments](#programming-assignments) |  36%  |
| [Exams](#exams)                                     |  36%  |
| Group Project                                       |  16%  |
| [Participation](#participation)                     |  12%  |

### Programming Assignments

Programming assignments will consist of three parts:
- Development of a library of functions that perform a set of tasks
- Visualization and analysis using the functions developed during the first half
- Reviews of your classmates work

The goal of these three parts is to give you experience in the three major aspects of data analysis and machine learning: 
development of new module and code,
analysis of data,
interpreting the work of others.

Assignments will generally span two weeks, with the first week focusing on the development of library functions and review of the previous week's analysis, and the second week will focus on your own analysis and visualization.

Therefore, there will be three parts to how you are assess:
1. The python code you develop will be checked against unit tests to ensure expected functionality (roughly 50%)
2. Your visualization and analysis, based on how well I and your peers understand your interpretation and the validity (roughly 30%)
3. Your analysis of your peer's visualization and analysis. (roughly 20%)


### Exams

There will be three exams in this course worth each worth roughly 12% of your grade.
Each one will cover a mixture of new and old material, with an emphasis on new material.
During the exam you will be allowed to use a calculator but no other electronics, and have a single sheet of notes.

These exams are spaced roughly 5 weeks apart and can be seen on the course [calendar](calendar.md).

Note: there is no final exam for this class, but we may have a project presentations period during this block.

### Participation

In-class participation has three components:

1. (5%) Learning Logs: reflect on the material you learned each week and use as notes for studying
2. (5%) Attendance: Show up to class on time every day
3. (2%) Weekly Surveys: to help me understand how to improve class

### Grade Assignment

Grades as assigned based on the standard ranges, which are outlined below.

| Grade Range     | Letter Grade |
|:----------------|:-------------|
| $[97,\infty)$   | A+           |
| $[93,97)$       | A            |
| $[90,93)$       | A-           |
| $[87,90)$       | B+           |
| $[83,87)$       | B            |
| $[80,83)$       | B-           |
| $[77,80)$       | C+           |
| $[73,77)$       | C            |
| $[70,73)$       | C-           |
| $[60,70)$       | D            |
| $[0,60)$        | F            |

## Course Policies

### Attendance

Students are expected to arrive to class on time and to attend every class.
Class attendance is one of the strongest factors for student performance. 
Attendance will be tracked either manually or with an attendance quiz.
While no retakes of a quiz or attendance will be allowed, the lowest 2 will be dropped.

### Late Policy

No late work will be accepted and no extensions will be granted.

The only exception to this is that the coding parts of homework can be turned in late, for a penalty.  
However, this will impact your ability to complete the visualization component so it is not recommended.

**If you do fall behind in class, please set up a time to meet with me to discuss getting you back on track – my goal is to have you succeed in class and I want to find a way to make that happen.**

## Academic Honor Code

**You may talk to other students or LLMs for:**

- Clarification on topics covered in class
- Clarification of what *provided* code is doing
- Generating more examples
- Understanding compiler errors

**You may *not* talk to other students or LLMs for:**

- Code and assignment answers
- Exam questions and answers

### The use of LLMs


**You may talk to other students or LLMs (e.g. ChatGPT) for:**

- Clarification on topics covered in class (e.g. paging, API usage, etc.)
- Clarification of what *provided* code is doing
- Generating more examples
- Understanding compiler errors

**You may *not* talk to other students or LLMs for:**

- Code and checkpoints answers – i.e. do not copy-and-paste code or answers from other students or LLMs
- Exam questions and answers

#### Details

At the highest level, the use of LLMs in this class is ***prohibited** for programming assignments* and ***encouraged** for improving your own understanding of material*.
Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT4.0, are powerful language generation models.
They can be used to produce code and summarize text, as well as answer clarifying questions.
They can be a very effective tool in a programmer’s toolbox if used appropriately.
In this class, you should use them as a resource similar to [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) – a good resource that should be critically considered since the code might be wrong, and not as effective as coming to talk to a TA or instructor.

**You may use** LLMs for asking clarifying questions and generating examples.
I will demonstrate a number of these such questions in class but “how do I use XX command?” and “how does a free list in memory management work?” are examples.
Additionally, asking for example problems (e.g. “can I have five examples of turnaround time calculation with FIFO and RR scheduling?”) is an excellent use[^4].
Further, if you are confused about what a homework problem is asking or how it relates to operating systems at a larger scale you can ask them[^5].

**You may *not*** use LLMs for producing answers on programming assignments, quizzes or exams.
Asking for an LLM’s solution to a coding assignment is conceptually the same as asking another student to write you code for you, and will be treated as such.
While you may ask for individual parts to help understand the C language better (e.g. “how do I write a do-while loop in C”), using it for more than ~2 lines of code is not allowed.
As a rule of thumb, a prompt of “write me a function to do...” indicates that you are headed in a problematic direction.

You are encouraged to use LLMs like you would a TA or an instructor.
You *may not* use LLMs for producing code for programming assignments, but *may* use it to learn how to better use the language and to clarify topics.
They can clarify complex topics we learned in class, give you alternative explanations and can be incredibly helpful in understanding errors and problems.
However, it is important to be able to identify *good* examples and *bad* examples of LLM output.
