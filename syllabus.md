# [COURSE_CODE] ([COURSE_NAME]) Syllabus

Note: All syllabi should conform to the defined syllabus structure.
For CSUMB that is under section 3.10 of [this document](https://csumb.edu/policy/course-syllabus-policy/).

## Summary

[Brief description of the course goals and what students will learn]

- **Grading:**
There are three assignment groups that you must achieve a minimum grade of 40% in to pass the course.
They are [Programming Assignments](#programming-assignments) (35%), [Exams](#exams) (35%), and [Participation](#participation) (30%).
Final grades are calculated by rounding to the nearest whole number and converted to letter grades using the standard range.
*Details can be found in [grading](#grading).*

- **Late work:**
Late submissions are accepted only for Programming assignments and Labs, and have a 10% deduction per calendar day late.
*Details can be found in [late policy](#late-policy).*

- **Getting help:**
There are a ton of office hours spread throughout the week so make use of them if you have any questions!
In general, you can use the [class slack channel](#) to ask questions (but not post code!), or send me questions (code okay!) via slack or my email.
You are **not** allowed to use LLMs or classmates to write code for you, but you can ask them clarifying questions about material.
*Details can be found in [personnel](#personnel).*

**Any other questions?**
I tried to make this document exhaustive (and it just turned out exhausting...), but if there's something you can't find an answer to don't hesitate to reach out via slack or email!
